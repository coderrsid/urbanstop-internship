## Internship Task 

I have attached one png file with this message, you have to replicate the same using React.js for UI Components and D3.js for developing graph.

Extra details you might need to complete this task:
1. You're free to use any icons from FontAwesome.
2. Use D3.js for Graph
3. Use Poppins for font family (https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Poppins)

#### NOTE
I used AmChart instead, as the Gantt Chart in D3.js is in beta-version and could not be customised so easily. But i tried to replicate it at my best level.
